Linear Algebra Project
======================
This is a project for the course "Linear Algebra" at the University Khaje Nasir Toosi of Technology, Semester 4011.

In this project, we practiced concepts of linear algebra, such as:

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
- Differentiation
- Gradient Descent

The project compromises of five parts:

- Logistic Regression
- Logistic Regression using Tensorflow
- Multilayer Neural Network
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Bonus: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

I Implemented the following tasks:

- Logistic Regression
- Logistic Regression using Tensorflow
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Requirements
------------
The following packages are required to run the code:

* numpy
* matplotlib
* tensorflow

Conclusion
----------
The project was a great experience for me. I learned a lot about linear algebra and machine learning. I hope you enjoy
it too.
